To use, install =cronie=, looks like I need to start the cronie
service in systemctl.

Register the crontab jobs:


Modify the path in job.cron before running.

- crontab job.cron :: This will actually replace my current list of
  crontab jobs with the new list.

Other crontab commands:

- crontab -l :: list all cron jobs
- crontab -e :: launch EDITOR for current list
- crontab -r :: remove the entire list

Looks like crontab requires:

- it must be the full path to the script, not a command with arguments
- the script must be executable
- the cronie daemon must be running


* TODO will the job continue after reboot?
